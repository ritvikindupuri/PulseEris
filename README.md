## ðŸš€ How It Works

A typical incident workflow in PulsePoint ERIS looks like this:

1.  **Call Intake:** A dispatcher receives an emergency call and uses the "Log Emergency Call" form to input the details, assigning a priority level.
2.  **Dispatch:** The new call appears instantly in the dispatcher's "Active Calls" queue. The dispatcher checks the "Team Availability" panel to identify the nearest available EMT unit.
3.  **Assignment:** The call is assigned to an EMT. The call appears on that EMT's dashboard.
4.  **Response:** The EMT clocks in, views the call details and location on the map, and updates their status to "En Route" and then "On Scene". These status changes are reflected in real-time on the dispatcher's availability panel.
5.  **Reporting:** After resolving the incident, the EMT's status becomes "Submit PCR". They fill out the detailed Patient Care Record form.
6.  **Closure:** Once the PCR is submitted, the call status is automatically updated to "Closed" across the system.
7.  **Oversight:** A supervisor can log in at any time to see the updated incident log, view the PCR compliance rate, and export the data for weekly reports.
