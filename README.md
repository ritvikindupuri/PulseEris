## âœ¨ Core Features

PulsePoint ERIS provides a tailored experience for each role within an emergency response organization.

### For Dispatchers
- **AI-Assisted Call Logging:** A dedicated form to quickly capture critical information, with a Gemini-powered AI that automatically suggests a priority level based on the incident description.
- **AI-Powered Location Intelligence:** Using Gemini with Google Maps Grounding, dispatchers can verify an address, get a summary of potential access challenges for an ambulance, and see a list of nearby hospitals, all before dispatching a unit.
- **Live Status Map:** A dynamic map providing a real-time (simulated) view of all active incidents and team locations.
- **Interactive Call Queue:** View all pending incidents, automatically sorted by priority, with a clear visual distinction for Priority 1 calls.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Instantly find pending calls by location, description, or priority level.
- **Efficient Dispatching:** Select a pending call and assign it to any available team with a single click.
- **End-of-Day Reporting with AI Analysis:** Generate an instant report summarizing the day's key metrics, and use Gemini to create a qualitative analysis of trends, anomalies, and potential operational improvements.

### For EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians)
- **Focused Assignment View:** A clear, detailed card shows the current active assignment, including location, caller details, and incident description.
- **Interactive Status Updates:** Manage your response status with a logical workflow of action buttons: "On Scene," "Transporting," and "Complete Call."
- **Clock In / Out:** Easily manage your on-duty status for the day.
- **Interactive AI Scribe for PCRs:** After completing a call, fill out a comprehensive form and use the **AI Scribe** to instantly generate professional narratives from raw notes. The generated text can be copied to the main notes field for review and editing.
- **Offline Capability:** File Patient Care Records even without an internet connection. The system automatically saves them locally and syncs them once connectivity is restored, with clear status indicators.
- **Shift Summary Analytics:** An at-a-glance dashboard with a doughnut chart showing a breakdown of calls handled by priority during the current shift.

### For Supervisors
- **High-Level Operational Dashboard:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) are displayed in clear "stat cards," showing open incidents, PCRs filed, and personnel status.
- **Advanced Team Roster Management:** View, filter, and manage all teams. An intuitive modal allows for editing team names, grades, and member assignments, with visibility into each member's certifications.
- **Personnel Management:** A dedicated tab allows supervisors to manage their EMTs, including editing their certifications to keep records up-to-date.
- **Weekly Scheduling Tool:** A powerful scheduling interface to assign teams to day and night shifts for the entire week.
- **AI-Powered Shift Handover Reporting:** Generate an "Exception Report" that lists all currently open incidents, and use Gemini to create an **AI-generated summary** to highlight critical information for the incoming shift, with an option to regenerate the summary as needed.
- **Full Data Export:** Export the complete list of open incidents to a CSV file with a single click.

### For COOs (Chief Operating Officers)
- **Executive SLA Dashboard:** An analytics-focused dashboard for viewing Service Level Agreement (SLA) performance.
- **Key Performance Metrics:** Stat cards display critical metrics like Average Dispatch Time, Average On-Scene Time, Average Total Response Time, and overall SLA Compliance Percentage.
- **SLA Compliance Visualization:** A clear bar chart shows the percentage of responses that met or missed the target response time.

### For Administrators
- **System Audit Log:** A comprehensive, immutable log of all significant actions taken within the system.
- **Data Export:** Export the complete audit log to a CSV file for offline analysis and record-keeping.
- **System Backup:** A one-click function to trigger a manual system backup (simulated).

### System-Wide Features
- **Secure Authentication:** A complete login and sign-up system ensures only authorized personnel can access the system.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The interface and capabilities are automatically tailored to the logged-in user's role.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Dark & Light Mode:** A theme toggle to reduce eye strain, especially crucial for dispatchers working in low-light environments.
